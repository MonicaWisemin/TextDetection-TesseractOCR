Our teacher told me to write a ReadMe so m here.:/         
This code is used for text detection, with Tesseract OCR and different kinds of threshold method(mean adaptive threshold / Gaussian adaptive threshold), different neighbourhood and iteration group of dialte ((3,3) w iterations = 2 / (5,5) w iterations = 1)       
and different filter (median filter / Gaussian filter) to decrease the noise.        
The parametres are suitble for the test picture, so is the measurement of efficiency and effectiveness. Have fun trying it out with other images;)
